This project is a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors console game written in C++ as a learning and practice project.

The game allows the player to choose how many rounds to play and then compete against the computer. In each round, the player selects an option (stone, scissor, or paper), the computer generates a random choice, and the program determines the winner based on the game rules.

The program displays the result of each round, keeps track of wins, losses, and draws, and shows a final game summary at the end. Console colors are used to visually indicate the winner.
